- If you read the value of an undeclared variable; Javascript generates an error.
- If you assign a value to an undeclared variable;
	- In ES5 strict mode, Javascript generates an error.
	- In non-strict mode, Javascript creates that variable as a property of the global object, and it works much like (but not exactly the same as) a properly declared global variable.
