```

- `git log` lists the commits in reverse chronological order  with
	- SHA-1 checksum,
	- the authorâ€™s name and e-mail,
	- the date written, and
	- the commit message.

	- `-p`
		- Show the difference introduced in each commit.
		- This is very helpful for code review or to quickly browse what happened during a series of commits that a collaborator has added.
	- `-n`
		- Limit the output to only the last n commits.
	- `--stat`
		- Print below each commit entry a list of modified files, how many files were changed, and how many lines in those files were added and removed.
		- It also puts a summary of the information at the end.
	- `--pretty=oneline|short|full|fuller|format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s`
		- Show commits in an alternate format
		- oneline: prints sha hash and commit message on a single line.
		- short, full, and fuller: show the output in the same format but with less or more information.
	- `--graph`  
		- Add a nice little ASCII graph showing your branch and merge history.
	- `--name-only`
		- Show the list of files modified after the commit information.
	- `--name-status`
		- Show the list of files affected with added/modified/deleted information as well.
	- `--abbrev-commit`
		- Show only the first few characters of the SHA-1 checksum instead of all 40.
	- `--relative-date`
		- Display the date in a relative format (for example, "2 weeks ago") instead of using the full date format.
	- `--since=2.weeks|2008-01-15|2 years 1 day 3 minutes ago`
	- `--until=2.hours.ago`
	- `--author`
		- Allows you to filter on a specific author.
		- If you want to specify both author and grep options, you have to add `--all-match` or the command will match commits with either
	- `--committer`
		- Allows you to filter on a specific committer.
	- `--grep`
		- Lets you search for keywords in the commit messages.
		- If you want to specify both author and grep options, you have to add `--all-match` or the command will match commits with either
	- `-S`
		- Takes a string and only shows the commits that introduced a change to the code that added or removed that string.
		- For instance, if you wanted to find the last commit that added or removed a reference to a specific function, you could call:
		- `$ git log -Sfunction_name`
	- `--decorate`
		- Show what branches points to which commits.
