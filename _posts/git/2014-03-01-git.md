### Centralized Version Control Systems
- They have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place.
- ex. CVS, Subversion.
- Most operations are remote.
	- To compare a file with the version 1 month old, the history is fetched from server and the diff is computed or the diff is fetched.
- Disadvantages
	- Single point of failure.
		- If that server goes down for an hour, during that hour nobody can collaborate at all or save versioned changes to anything they’re working on.
		- If the hard disk the central database is on becomes corrupted, and proper backups haven’t been kept, you lose absolutely everything.
	- If you are offline, you can't perform most operations.
	- Most operations have network latency overhead.

### Distributed Version Control Systems

- ex. Git, Mercurial, Bazaar, Darcs.
- Everybody has a complete copy (including history) of the repo.
- Most operations are local.
	- To compare a file with the version 1 month old, you just make a diff locally.
- Advantages:
	- Operations are very fast, no network latency.
	- You can work offline.
	- If one of the repo gets destroyed everybody else has the complete repo.


## Git

- Linux Kernel project was being developed by using a distributed control system called BitKeeper.
- In 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the Linux kernel and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke down, and the tool’s free-of-charge status was revoked.
- This led Linus Torvalds to develop a new tool.


### Data Model

- Most systems store information as a list of file-based changes. These systems think of the information they keep as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time.

- Git thinks of its data like a set of snapshots of a mini filesystem. Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file again — just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored.

- Git benefits from thinking its data this way especially when implementing branches.



### Integrity

- Everything in Git is check-summed before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum.
- Therefore it’s impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it. You can’t lose information in transit or get file corruption without Git being able to detect it.
- The mechanism that Git uses for this checksumming is called a SHA–1 hash. This is a 40-character string composed of hexadecimal characters and calculated based on the contents of a file or directory structure in Git.
- A SHA–1 hash looks something like this: `24b9da6552252987aa493b52f8696cd6d3b00373`
- Git stores everything not by file name but in the Git database addressable by the hash value of its contents.
