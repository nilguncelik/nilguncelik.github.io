- Git is a distributed repository:
	- Up until now, most of the source control systems had central repositories.
		- If you loose all of your backups and the server goes down you are out of luck.
	- But git is distributed. Everybody has a complete copy of the repo. This has following advantages:
		- You can make commits quickly.
		- You can work offline.
		- If one of the repo gets destroyed everybody else also has the complete repo.


- Initial configuration:

```sh
git config --global user.name "myusername"
git config --global user.email "myemail"

git config --global color.ui true
git config format.pretty oneline
```

- Showing configuration:

```sh
git config --list
git config user.name
```

- Creating aliases:

```sh
git config --global alias.st status
git st
# alias for git status
```

- Starting a repo:

```sh
mkdir repo
cd repo
git init
# initialises an empty git repository by creating .git folder
```

- Your local repository consists of 3 trees maintained by git.
	- `Working Directory`: holds the actual files.
	- `Index (Staging Area)`: acts as a staging area.
	- `HEAD`: pointer to the last commit you have made in the current branch.

#### Git workflow

- Make some changes. (Working Directory)
	- eg. create a file or update a file.
- (Add) file to staging area. (Index)
- (Commit) changes. (HEAD)
- Working Directory(unstaged) -> (add) -> Index (staged) -> (commit) -> HEAD (committed).


- Adding files to staging area:

```sh
git add <list of files>
git add "*.txt"
# stage all txt files in whole project.
git add --all
# stage all new or modified files.
git add *
# stage all new or modified files.
```

- Deleting files from local filesystem and untracking (staging for removal):

```sh
git rm '*.txt'
git rm --cached development.log
# stop tracking the file, but the file is not deleted from local filesystem.
```


- Commiting changes to HEAD:

```sh
git commit -m "This is a commit message"
git commit -a -m "Commit message"
# a option: stage all tracked files but ignore untracked files.
git commit -amend -m "This overrides previous commit message"
# amend option: changes last commit message, may also add extra files to it.
```

- Showing what has changed since your last commit:

```sh
git status
git status -s(hort)
# to see actual changes use "git diff"
```

- Showing commit logs, including id, sha hash, author, date, commit message for a commit:

```sh
git log
git log --pretty=oneline
# show sha hash and commit message on one line.
git log --pretty=format:"%h %ad- %s [%an]"
git log --oneline -p(atch)
# show what lines removed, what lines added during each commit.
git log --graph
# show visual representation of commits and merges.
git log --since=1.day.ago --untill=2.hours.ago
git log --graph --decorate --all --pretty --oneline --author --name-status
```

- Showing a specific commit:

```sh
git show commitId
```


- Showing unstaged differences (to see only the file names use "git status"):

```sh
git diff (HEAD)
# unstaged differences between working copy and last commit.
git diff HEAD^
# unstaged differences between working copy and parent of latest commit.
git diff HEAD~5
# unstaged differences between working copy and 5 commits ago.
git diff commitId1 commitId2
# differences between two commits TODO
git diff <sourceBranch> <targetBranch>
# view differences between two branches TODO
```

- Showing staged differences:

```sh
git diff --staged
```

- Showing all the changes at each line who made them, when, at which commit:

```sh
git blame <filename>
```


#### Undoing

- Jumping forward/backward in time:

```sh
git checkout commitId
```

- Unstaging a staged file (when you don’t want to send staged files with the same commit):

```sh
git reset (HEAD) <file>
```

- Removing all changes you made since last commit and replacing them with HEAD:

```sh
git checkout -- <list of files>
# changes already added to index and new files will not be removed.
```

- Dropping commits:

```sh
git reset --soft HEAD^
# undo last commit and put changes into staging.
git commit --hard HEAD^
# undo last commit, remove all changes.
git commit --hard HEAD^^
# undo last two commits, remove all changes.
```

- Dropping all your local changes and commits:

```sh
git fetch origin
# fetch the latest history from the server.
git reset --hard origin/master
# point your local master branch at it.
```


#### Remote Repositories

- Showing remote repositories:

```sh
git remote -v
```

- Adding/Removing remote repositories:

```sh
git remote add <name> <address>
git remote add origin https:/github.com/username/git-real.git
# origin will refer to given url.
git remote rm <name>
```

- Fetching changes from remote repository:

```sh
git fetch
# goes to remote and pulls down any changes but does not merge them.
```

- Pushing changes to remote repository:

```sh
git push -u <repository-name> <branch-name>
git push -u origin master
# push to remote repository (origin) from local branch (master)
# u option : tells git to remember the parameters, so that next time you run git push, git will know what to do.
```

- Updating local repository with changes from remote repository:

	```sh
	git pull (origin master)
	```
	1. Fetches/syncs local repository with the remote one. But it actually does not update any of our local code.
		- Actually it creates a new branch called `origin/master`.
		- Same as `git fetch`.
	2. Merges origin/master with master.
		- Same as `git merge origin/master`.
		- Pops up a new editor to enter a new commit message.
		- Creates a new commit for this merge.


- Resolving conflicts:

	```sh
	# Without conflict:
	git push
	# rejected
	git pull
	git push

	# With conflict:
	git pull
	# conflict
	git status
	# manually edit conflicted files.
	git commit -a
	git push
	```

	- <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18050220/eclipse-egit-checkout-conflict-with-files-egit-doesnt-want-to-continue>




- Creating a new copy:

	```sh
	git clone <address>
	git clone <address> <local folder name>
	git clone /path/to/local/repository
	# clone local repository
	git clone username@host:/path/to/repository
	# clone remote repository
	```
	1. Downloads entire repository to a new directory.
	2. Adds a remote repository called `origin` which points to `<address>`.
	3. Checks out initial branch - most likely `master` - and sets the `HEAD`.



#### Branches

- When developers are working on a feature or bug they'll often create a copy (aka. branch) of their code they can make separate commits to. Then when they're done they merge this branch back into their `master` branch.
- master: pointer to main branch
- origin/master: remote pointer


- Showing current branch:

```sh
git branch
```

- Creating a new branch:

```sh
git branch <branch-name>
```


- Switching to a branch:

```
git checkout <branch-name>
# HEAD now points to <branch-name>.
git checkout -b <branch-name>
# create and switch to branch.
```


- Deleting a branch:

```
git branch -d <branch-name>
```

- Merging branches:

	```sh
	git checkout master & git merge <another-branch>
	```
	- Merge changes from <another-branch> to master.
	- If `master` branch has not changed since `<another-branch>` was created, git does a **fast-forward**.
	- If changes were made to both branches a recursive merge is executed.


- Showing remote branches:

```sh
git branch -r
git remote show <repository_name>
# shows local branches and which remote branches they merge with
# shows local branches commit statuses
```

- Pushing a branch to a remote repository:

```sh
git push <repository_name> <branch name>
```

- Deleting a remote branch:

```sh
git push <repository_name> :<branch name>
# deletes remote branch but does not remove local one.
git branch -d branch
# throws error if there are unmerged changes in the branch.
git branch -D branch
# if there are unmerged changed -d gives error but -D overrides the error.
git remote prune origin
# when remote repository is deleted by someone else, you have dangling reference to remote branch.
# this command removes that reference and the repository becomes a local one.
```

#### Tags

- Tags can be used for release versioning.

- Listing all tags

```sh
git tag
```

- Checking out a tag ( going to the version when you tagged )

```sh
git checkout v0.0.1
```

- Adding a new tag

```sh
git tag -a v0.0.3 -m "version 0.0.3"
```


- Pushing new tags

```sh
git push --tags
```

#### Rebasing

- Merging commits can pollute your history.

	```sh
	git fetch
	git rebase
	```
	1. move all changes to master which are not in `origin/master` to a temporary area. (move your own changes to a temporary area).
	2. run all `origin/master` commits.
	3. run all commits in the temporary area, one at a time on top of origin master.
	4. Nothing is merged during the process.


- Rebasing a local branch:

```sh
git checkout <branch-name>
git rebase master
git checkout master
git merge <branch-name>
# this will be fast-forward.
# will not show any merge in history.
# if there are conflicts you can manually resolve them and execute
git rebase --continue
# or you can skip conflict or abort rebase:
git rebase --skip
git rebase --abort
```


#### Excluding files

- vi .git/info/exclude
- write down logs/ and save quit.
- logs folder will not be committed and git status won't see it.

- vi .gitignore
- write down logs/ and save quit.
- this will ignore logs folder for all people using this repository.
