### Virtual Machines

![](/img/virtual_machine.png)

- They manage security and resource sharing.
- But they are inefficient (each vm allocates resources for the guest os).

## Containers

- What is a container?
	- It is OS Level Virtualization :
		- A server virtualization method where the kernel of an operating system allows for multiple isolated user space instances, instead of just one.
	- Containers may look and feel like a real server from the point of view of its owners and users.

- Works as a process.
	- Efficient scheduling.
	- Less overhead.
- Boot very fast compared to virtual machines.
- Crash management and resiliency
	- Easy to kill and restart
	- Limits DDOS attacks. One container can be hit by DDOS, but another mat not be hit. You can easily kill and start another.
- Portable - runs same everywhere.
- Kernel provides isolation and resource management based on LXC (Linux Containers)
	- Provides base OS container templates and a comprehensive set of tools for container lifecycle management.
	- Kernel level namespace isolation and security.
		- Two separate processes can have same id in container but they are different according to OS.
		- Two separate containers can see different drivers named as C.
		- pid, mnt, net, uts, ipc, user,...
	- cgroup
		- Kernel feature for limiting resource usage (cpu, memory, bulkio, devices)
- When you start a new container:
	- It is like starting a new process on the operation system, no other overhead.
	- No disk storage required.
	- No OS booting required.
- When you quit the container, any data written on storage is deleted. If you mount a folder, data on the folder is deleted also unless another process is using it.

### Docker

- Standardizes Linux container technology so that you can put your application in a container an then host it in any type of environment which supports the standard.
- With docker you can build a container that has everything you need to configure your application: dependencies and services. These container can than be shared and run on a server without doing a whole bunch set of configuration.
- Docker containers use an execution environment called `libcontainer`, which is an interface to various Linux kernel isolation features, like `namespaces` and `cgroups`.
	- ![](/img/libcontainer.png)
- AUFS union filesystem
	- Docker Images are virtual OS images and technically they have way less footprint than the actual OS images. Due to the AUFS filesystem, all the committed writes to the filesystem are stacked, therefore can be unified to the last revision any point in time.
	- Due to the nature of the filesystem all these write operations are also cacheable. Meaning, if Docker finds out that you don't have any changes up to a certain revision, it plays everything up to that particular revision from the cache and rest by applying the writes. This gives a huge performance benefits on provisioning time.
	-  When a docker container runs only the top layer is read write, all the layers beneath are read only, and the top layer is transient data until it is committed to a new layer.
- Only 64-bit is supported.

**Docker Containers**

- Just binary files that contains the application and dependencies needed to run the application.

**Docker Engine**

- Thin layer on top of host OS.
- Uses host to run processes but these processes are sandboxed.

- Assume you have Fedora as your host OS. And you pull and run ubuntu docker image.
	- This instance does not allocate resources for ubuntu OS like a traditional VM does.
	- Instead it maps to host OS resources and shares host OS's kernel.
	- But you have ubuntu specific bins like apt-get.

**Images vs Containers**

- Images are read-only templates for starting new containers.
- They are immutable snapshots that are frozen. You can add something to the image but this time you create another image. This leads to a layered approach. This layered mechanism is built similar to git where each image is base image + changes i.e. each image is a diff from its parent image.
- When you write to running container only diffs are recorded in the file system.
- You can create many container instances from a single image.

**Docker Workflow**

There are two major ways to work with docker.

1 - Manual Commiting

![](/img/manual_image_creation.png)

- You write your application and make configurations.
- Commit your app and configuration.
- Checkout your instance on another machine and use.
- This is way is not recommended.

```sh
$ docker run -i -t debian /bin/bash
$ apt-get install postgresql-9.3
$ docker ps
$ docker commit <CID> username/postgresql
$ docker login
$ docker push username/postgresql
# on another computer
$ docker pull username/postgresql
```

2- Dockerfile

- Set parent image and then run series of commands.
- Recommended way.
- Dockerfile also serves as a documentation what you did to create that image.
- You still need to push and pull commands manually to get the new image to the Hub.

```sh
$ docker build -t <image-name> <directory>
# includes all the elements in the directory when the source file is built to an image repository.
# will create a reusable image, will not run it.
```
- [Reference for writing Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/).
- Docker encourage immutable deployment units. You should not ssh into container and do upgrades. Instead just change the version number of the base image and then rebuilt your application container and deploy it. If you start to connect with ssh to your container then you break the nature of immutability and you are creating something that is not exactly reproducible.

**Docker commands**

```sh
$ sudo docker -d &
# run docker as deamon
$ sudo docker ps
# show running instances together with their container ids.
$ sudo docker search ubuntu
# search existing remote images from Index/Hub (https://index.docker.io)
$ sudo docker login
# login to Hub.
$ sudo docker pull ubuntu
# download ubuntu image and put in cache.
$ sudo docker images
# show local downloaded or built (from Dockerfile) images.
$ sudo docker run <image-name> <options> <commands>
# some containers have commands baked in so you dont always have to specify it.
$ sudo docker run ubuntu echo "Hello"
# run instance
# instance will exit after executing the command
$ sudo docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash
# run instance
# instance will open an interactive shell and will not exit
# you can disconnect without existing instance by pressing ctl+p ctl+q
$ sudo docker run -i -t centos:centos6  /bin/bash
$ sudo docker run -p 49168:8080 -d <image-name>
# assign host's port 49168 to containers port 8080.
# you can access to web server running on port 8080 in the container by issuing following command: "curl -i localhost:49168"
$ sudo docker start <CID>
$ sudo docker stop <CID>
$ sudo docker kill <CID>
# kill running docker instance.
$ sudo docker logs <CID>
# show standard output.
```

**Docker run options**

- `--link`
	- If you link mysql server and nginx server they can recognize ports of each other.

- `-v`
	- give host folder to docker.

- `-p`
	- The port that are going to be opened.
	- These are assigned to random ports in the host system.

- `-t`
	- allocate pseudo tty interaction

- `-i`
	- keep standard in open even something is not attached

- `-env`
	- provide env file or prod parameters from outside.

- `-d`
	- deamon mode



### Service Discovery and Global Configuration Stores

- Allows applications to obtain the data needed to connect with to the services they depend on.
- Allows services to register their connection information for the above purpose.
- Provides a globally accessible location to store arbitrary configuration data.
- ex. ZooKeeper, Consul, etcd, crypt, confd

### Networking

- Docker's native networking capabilities:
	1 - expose a container's ports and optionally map to the host system for external routing.
	2 - allow containers to communicate by using Docker "links".
- Some additional networking capabilities available through additional tools:
	- Overlay networking to simplify and unify the address space across multiple hosts.
	- Virtual private networks adapted to provide secure communication between various components.
	- Assigning per-host or per-application subnetting
	- Establishing macvlan interfaces for communication
	- Configuring custom MAC addresses, gateways, etc. for your containers
- ex. flannel, weave, pipework


### Scheduling, Cluster Management, and Orchestration

- Schedulers are responsible for starting containers on the available hosts. It has functions that automate host selection process with the administrator having the option to specify certain constraints.

**Docker Machine, Swarm and Compose**

- Docker Machine, allows developers to quickly spin up Docker on a variety of cloud platforms. You can start remote machines on the cloud providers with Docker installed using command line. Then, you can run docker commands in the remote machine.
- Docker Swarm provides developers with a native clustering and scheduling solution.
- [Demo of the Machine + Swarm + Compose integration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4PFY6RZQHQ)


**CoreOS**

- is a minimal host OS (Linux) for Docker.

- Instead of installing packages via yum or apt, CoreOS uses Linux containers to manage your services at a higher level of abstraction. A single service's code and all dependencies are packaged within a container that can be run on one or many CoreOS machines.


**Mesosphere**

- An orchestration tool from Twitter

**Kubernetes**

- An orchestration tool from Google
- for clustering Docker containers across nodes.
- inspired by Googles internal systems like Borg/Omega.
