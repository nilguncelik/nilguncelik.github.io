### Docker

- Standardizes Linux container technology so that you can put your application in a container an then host it in any type of environment which supports the standard.
- With docker you can build a container that has everything you need to configure your application: dependencies and services. These container can than be shared and run on a server without doing a whole bunch set of configuration.
- Docker containers use an execution environment called `libcontainer`, which is an interface to various Linux kernel isolation features, like `namespaces` and `cgroups`.

- AUFS union filesystem
	- Docker Images are virtual OS images and technically they have way less footprint than the actual OS images. Due to the AUFS filesystem, all the committed writes to the filesystem are stacked, therefore can be unified to the last revision any point in time.
	- Due to the nature of the filesystem all these write operations are also cacheable. Meaning, if Docker finds out that you don't have any changes up to a certain revision, it plays everything up to that particular revision from the cache and rest by applying the writes. This gives a huge performance benefits on provisioning time.
	-  When a docker container runs only the top layer is read write, all the layers beneath are read only, and the top layer is transient data until it is committed to a new layer.
- Only 64-bit is supported.

**Docker Containers**

- Just binary files that contains the application and dependencies needed to run the application.

**Docker Engine**

- Thin layer on top of host OS.
- Uses host to run processes but these processes are sandboxed.

- Assume you have Fedora as your host OS. And you pull and run ubuntu docker image.
	- This instance does not allocate resources for ubuntu OS like a traditional VM does.
	- Instead it maps to host OS resources and shares host OS's kernel.
	- But you have ubuntu specific bins like apt-get.

**Images vs Containers**

- Images are read-only templates for starting new containers.
- They are immutable snapshots that are frozen. You can add something to the image but this time you create another image. This leads to a layered approach. This layered mechanism is built similar to git where each image is base image + changes i.e. each image is a diff from its parent image.
- When you write to running container only diffs are recorded in the file system.
- You can create many container instances from a single image.
