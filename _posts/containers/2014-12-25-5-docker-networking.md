### Service Discovery and Global Configuration Stores

- Allows applications to obtain the data needed to connect with to the services they depend on.
- Allows services to register their connection information for the above purpose.
- Provides a globally accessible location to store arbitrary configuration data.
- ex. ZooKeeper, Consul, etcd, crypt, confd

### Networking

- Docker's native networking capabilities:
	1 - expose a container's ports and optionally map to the host system for external routing.
	2 - allow containers to communicate by using Docker "links".
- Some additional networking capabilities available through additional tools:
	- Overlay networking to simplify and unify the address space across multiple hosts.
	- Virtual private networks adapted to provide secure communication between various components.
	- Assigning per-host or per-application subnetting
	- Establishing macvlan interfaces for communication
	- Configuring custom MAC addresses, gateways, etc. for your containers
- ex. flannel, weave, pipework
