# Running (Creating an instance)

`docker run <image-name> <options> <commands>`

- ex. `docker run ubuntu echo "Hello"`

### run - instance will exit after executing the command
`docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash`

### run - instance will open an interactive shell and will not exit
`docker run -it centos:centos6  /bin/bash`

- `-t`: allocate pseudo tty interaction
- `-i`: keep standard in open even something is not attached
- `-env`: provide env file or prod parameters from outside.
